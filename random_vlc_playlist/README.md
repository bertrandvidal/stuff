RANDOM VLC PLAYLIST
===================

Using m3u format generate a random playlist from a given folder. Each video
file will be played for a random time between 1 minute and 10 minutes starting
anywhere in the video.

It is mostly useless but I want to use this to display movie extracts during a
party or something like that.
